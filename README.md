# Final Thoughts & Future Features
*After creating the model and comparing it to the actual prices it is evident that there is a lot of potential here. This model was done with a limited sample of historical data. By adding more data points by increasing the timeframe and observing the relationships between more stocks we will be able to close the gap between the predictions and reality.

Right now there are only 4 stocks being compared. In the future, I plan to create a front end UI that will allow users to choose what stocks they wish to compare and analyze. This will help further improve the LSTM and add more functionality to the model.*
